1) These scripts were used to create 100 parametric bootstrapped MSFSs (1_create_boot.sh). 
2) Then, these MSFSs were used to compute the composite likelihood under the first three best scenarios (2_boot_comp.sh). 
3) Data was used to calculate CRL and to get the distribution of population parameters (3_get_data.sh).
